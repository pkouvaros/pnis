Advances in interconnectivity of autonomous services and machine learning fuel
the development of MAS with arbitrarily many neural-symbolic components, thereby
creating a pressing need for their verification. 

Towards addressing this need,
in this paper we put forward a number of automated procedures for the formal
analysis of parameterised, neural-symbolic MAS. The procedures enable
conclusions to be drawn on the satisfaction of temporal properties irrespective
of the number of agents composing the MAS. They can additionally identify
emergence thresholds expressing sufficient conditions on the number agents
for a property to be realised.

The theoretical results have driven the implementation of a parameterised,
neural-symbolic verifier, which we used to reason about a simple social dilemma
game. More generally, the techniques here developed  can be used to analyse
properties of policies learned to deal with real-life challenges that come in
the form of collective risk dilemmas, as well as properties in swarm scenarios
and open systems in general.
% CRDs, e.g., the collective maintenance of Earth's habitat by
% humanity \cite{Smirnov19}.
% The solution to the verification and emergence identification problems
% presented here provides a framework for creating autonomous agents which can
% avoid mutual defection in CRDs, as well as for analysing models of natural
% systems which already do.
% Other interesting examples include swarm scenarios inspired by the huddling of
% emperor penguins to conserve energy and incubate eggs
% \cite{LeMaho1977,GilbertRLNA06} during the arctic winter, the success of which
% depends on a slow rotation of members of the formation away from the chilling
% wind \cite{WatersBK12}.

In future work we target the development of parameterised methods for
interleaved semantics for neural-symbolic MAS and strategic properties.
