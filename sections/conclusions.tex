Advances in interconnectivity of autonomous services and machine learning fuel
the development of MAS with arbitrarily many neural-symbolic components,
thereby creating a pressing need for their verification. Towards addressing
this need, in this paper we put forward a number of automated procedures for
the formal analysis of parameterised, neural-symbolic MAS. The procedures
enable conclusions to be drawn on the satisfaction of temporal properties
irrespective of the number of agents composing the MAS and can identify
emergence thresholds expressing the sufficient conditions on the number agents
for a property to be realised. The theoretical results driven the
implementation of parameterised, neural-symbolic verifier, which we used to
reason about a social dilemma game. In future work we target the development of
parameterised methods for interleaved semantics and strategic properties.
