Advances in interconnectivity of autonomous services and machine learning fuel
the development of MAS with arbitrarily many neural-symbolic components,
thereby creating a pressing need for their verification. Towards addressing
this need, in this paper we put forward a number of automated procedures for
the formal analysis of parameterised, neural-symbolic MAS. The procedures
enable conclusions to be drawn on the satisfaction of temporal properties
irrespective of the number of agents composing the MAS and can identify
emergence thresholds expressing the sufficient conditions on the number agents
for a property to be realised.

The theoretical results are driven by the implementation of a parameterised,
neural-symbolic verifier, which we used to reason about a simple social dilemma
game. More generally, the techniques developed here can be used to analyse
properties of policies learned to deal with real-life challenges which come in
the form of CRDs, e.g., the collective maintenance of Earth's habitat by
humanity \cite{Smirnov19}.
% The solution to the verification and emergence identification problems
% presented here provides a framework for creating autonomous agents which can
% avoid mutual defection in CRDs, as well as for analysing models of natural
% systems which already do.
Other interesting examples include swarm scenarios inspired by the huddling of
emperor penguins to conserve energy and incubate eggs
\cite{LeMaho1977,GilbertRLNA06} during the arctic winter, the success of which
depends on a slow rotation of members of the formation away from the chilling
wind \cite{WatersBK12}.

In future work we plan to target the development of parameterised methods for
interleaved semantics and strategic properties.
