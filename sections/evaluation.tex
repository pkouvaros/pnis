In this section we present an evaluation of the parameterised verification
procedure described in Section~\ref{sec:verification} for the guarding game
presented in Example~\ref{ex:agent-template}.


The guarding game is an instance of a social dilemma game
\cite{LeiboZLMG17}. Such games are characterised by an intrinsic tension
between individual and collective goals.

We used reinforcement learning to learn the neural observation function, where
the agents have been given instantaneous rewards when ...

deep Q-learning..

The resulting NN has 1 hidden layer of .. neurons and ReLU activation function.



Given the neural network implementing the observation function, we 
implemented an agent template and a zero-one agent for the guarding game. We
then used the \venmas toolkit developed for verification of
NISs~\cite{Akintunde+20b} to verify $\bctl$ properties checking whether it is
possible for a colony of agents to survive after a number of time steps.

We assume that $M_h = 4$, $G_r = -2$, $R_r = 1$ and $U_r = -3$. 

Assume the set $\atprop$ and the labelling function $\ell$ as in
Example~\ref{ex:pnis}. We evaluate the zero-one NIS
$\pnis_{zo} = \tuple{\set{1,\ldots,m,zo,e}, \globalinit{m}_{zo}, \valuation{m}_{zo}}$
against two specifications:
$\varphi^k_1 = EX^k \bigwedge_{i=1}^m(\mathsf{a},i)$,
expressing that there is a way to choose agents' actions from those available
to them so that all three agents are alive after $k$ time steps, and
$\varphi^k_2 = AX^k (\mathsf{a},1) \land (\mathsf{a},2) \land (\mathsf{a},3)$,
expressing that for all possible evolutions after $k$ time steps all three
agents are alive.

The experiments have been performed on a standard PC running Ubuntu 22.04 with
16GB RAM and processor Intel(R) Core i5-4460 CPU @ 3.20GHz. We relied on Gurobi
v9.5.1 to solve MILP \cite{Gurobi+16a}.
